        <li>1 large bell pepper, deseeded & thinly sliced</li>

        <li>1 4-ounce can Thai-style green curry paste</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can light coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces baby spinach or greens of choice</li>
        <li>1-2 large, juicy limes, juiced</li>
        <li>kosher salt & ground black pepper, to season</li>
        <li>for serving, as desired: cooked rice (or quinoa, or cauliflower rice), Thai basil, cilantro,
            lime wedges, etc.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Cooking Steps</u></h3>

    <ol>
       
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum
            foil for easy clean up and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prep the chicken: Add the chicken, garlic, and ginger to a bowl, seasoning with 1 teaspoon kosher
            salt. Stir to evenly coat the chicken in the garlic & ginger. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Roast the broccoli & sweet potato: Place the broccoli florets & diced sweet potato on the prepared
            baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil over top & season with ½ teaspoon kosher salt.
            Toss to coat, then arrange the veggies in a single, uniform layer across the baking sheet. Once the
            oven is preheated, roast the veggies for 20-25 minutes, shaking the baking sheet halfway through, 
            until the veggies are crisp around the edges & fork-tender. Remove from the oven & set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the aromatic veggies: Add 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil to a deep skillet or Dutch oven
            over medium-high heat. Once hot, add in the thinly sliced onion & bell pepper, seasoning with a pinch
            of kosher salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender-crisp, 3-4 minutes. Transfer the veggies to a
            plate & set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken: If needed, add the remaining tablespoon of coconut oil to the skillet or Dutch oven
            used to cook the aromatic veggies. Once hot, add in the prepared chicken. Cook 4-5 minutes per side,
            until browned around the edges & nearly cooked through.</li>
        <li>Build & simmer the green curry: Add the curry paste to the skillet, stirring to coat the chicken. Cook
            2-3 minutes, allowing the curry paste to brown slightly. Add in the coconut cream & coconut milk. Simmer
            for about 10 minutes, until the broccoli & sweet potato finish roasting. Just before serving, stir in
            the spinach & the cooked onion & bell pepper from Step 4. Once the spinach is wilted, stir in the lime
            juice. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the green curry & roasted veggies over rice (or quinoa or cauliflower rice). Finish with
            fresh cilantro, Thai basil, and extra freshly squeezed lime juice as desired. Enjoy.</li>
